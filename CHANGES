* When monster bites you, now it chooses body part first. 
When you are trying to dodge, your dodge skill is decreased by encumbrance level of that body part.

* Reinforcing armor does not provide bash and cut protection bonus anymore

* Some creatures are attracted to the smell of damaged body parts and will prefer to attack them


TODO:
Creatures should have mutations too
